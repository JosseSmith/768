# About Me

My name is Josse Smith. I am 26 years old and grew up in Bloomington, Indiana. I attended college at DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana, then moved to Baltimore, Maryland for 3 years where I taught K-3rd grade. The high demand of teaching was simply not for me and that is where I found the LIS program.
